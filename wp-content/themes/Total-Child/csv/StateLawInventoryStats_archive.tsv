Introduction		What is the minimum number of voting members that must be present at a meeting in order for a vote to occur?

Some states will allow for directors to serve until their successors are elected, regardless of term expirations, or they’ll state that terms can be successive.

Description		Notice of meeting refers to the requirement of organizations to alert board members in advance of the date, time, and location for a board meeting. The provisions in Notice of Meeting and Waiver of Notice also define what constitutes “notice.” Below are the findings on a nationwide basis regarding notice of meeting. 	
Introduction		How and when must organizations alert board members of the date, time, and location of meetings? 	
Trends		States define two types of meetings. Regular meetings are those meetings that are included in the annual board calendar; special meetings are off-calendar meetings. <br><br> States don’t often require that notice be given for regular meetings, unless the bylaws so require.  In the case of special meetings, the most common requirement is 2 days' notice, required by 23 states.

Description		E-Meetings refer to the use of electronic communication technology by boards is commonly called "e-meeting." E-meeting refers to the use of technology to facilitate board communications, including: providing meeting notices, voting, approvals, board discussions, and other common board communications. Below are the findings on a nationwide basis regarding e-meeting.	
Introduction		To what degree are electronic communications able to replace hard copy mail to conduct board business? 	
Trends		Nearly all states allow for meetings to occur using electronic communication such as teleconference or videoconference, with only 2 states (MA, NH) leaving that decision to bylaws and 1 state (AK) remaining silent on the topic. <br><br> However, there are distinctions made by states in terms of how technology may be utilized.  One standard adopted by most states (36) specifies that everyone must be able to hear one another.  A different benchmark requires participants to be able to communicate with one another (7 states), or to specifically be able to do so concurrently (2 states, CA and TX). Finally, three states (MN, ND, OH) require that attendees can participate, which broadens the definition of communication to include such means as chats or sign language. In all cases, the crux is to foster an environment where an exchange is able to take place such as would happen in an in person meeting. <br><br> Participation in a meeting by means of any electronic communication always constitutes presence at a meeting.

Description		Actions refer to votes or any decision that requires the input of the full board. This specifically looks at requirements for taking an action without holding an associated meeting. Below are the findings on a nationwide basis regarding board actions without holding and associated meeting. 	
Introduction		What are the rules around board actions such as votes or any decision that requires the input of the full board? 	
Trends		All states allow for actions to be taken without a meeting. The most common requirement (41 states) is that any action taken without a meeting must be done via a unanimous written consent and included in recorded minutes. <br><br> The remainder of the states widely vary in terms of special provisions around how an action must be announced or with regard to the minimum number of votes required at an in person meeting to pass such an action. <br><br> Not all states specify that an action can be taken or signed using electronic means but unless “written” is defined in the statute, e-mails and other similar forms of communication are allowed. In such cases, all directors must be able to see the responses of each director and the signature is valid. It is a best practice, though not always a legal requirement, that such actions always be included in the organization’s minutes.

Description		Conflict of interest refers to the actions of board members that have a material interest – whether direct or indirect – in an issue being decided by the board. An example of a conflict of interest might be a board member who is a senior officer of a company with which the nonprofit is considering doing business. Below are the findings on a nationwide basis regarding disclosure of conflicts of interest.	
Introduction		In what manner must board members disclose actions and entities in which they have a material interest?	
Trends		While all states include language in their nonprofit codes identifying what constitutes a potential conflict of interest and provide rules governing the actions of interested members, few states explicitly require nonprofits to have a formal Conflict of Interest Policy.  Most states (42) simply define what a conflict of interest is and how it is to be reported and acted upon. Some states include provisions for interested directors and how their presence or participation in deliberations is counted.
