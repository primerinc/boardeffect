Introduction,,"To what degree are electronic communications able to replace hard copy mail to conduct board business?
",,
Trends,,"Nearly all states allow for meetings to occur using electronic communication such as teleconference or videoconference, with only 2 states (MA, NH) leaving that decision to bylaws and 1 state (AK) remaining silent on the topic.

However, there are distinctions made by states in terms of how technology may be utilized.  One standard adopted by most states (36) specifies that everyone must be able to hear one another.  A different benchmark requires participants to be able to communicate with one another (8 states), or to specifically be able to do so concurrently (1 state, IL). Finally, three states (MN, ND, OH) require that attendees can participate, which broadens the definition of communication to include such means as chats or sign language. In all cases, the crux is to foster an environment where an exchange is able to take place such as would happen in an in person meeting.

Participation in a meeting by means of any electronic communication always constitutes presence at a meeting.",,

Introduction,,"What are the rules around board actions such as votes or any decision that requires the input of the full board?
",,
Trends,,"All states allow for actions to be taken without a meeting. The most common requirement (41 states) is that any action taken without a meeting must be done via a unanimous written consent and included in recorded minutes.

The remainder of the states widely vary in terms of special provisions around how an action must be announced or with regard to the minimum number of votes required at an in person meeting to pass such an action.

Not all states specify that an action can be taken or signed using electronic means but unless “written” is defined in the statute, e-mails and other similar forms of communication are allowed. In such cases, all directors must be able to see the responses of each director and the signature is valid. It is a best practice, though not always a legal requirement, that such actions always be included in the organization’s minutes.

Some states include provisions for interested directors and how their presence or participation in deliberations is counted.
